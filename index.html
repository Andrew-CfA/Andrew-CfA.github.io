            income-qualified programs more accessible to the residents of the city (and now ARPA funded)! I utilized 
            JavaScript, HTML and Python (via Django framework) to create the frontend and backend of the website to 
            ensure a clean, responsive UI and devOps (via GitHub, Docker & Azure) designed to help residents of 
            Fort Collins who are in need. The web app currently uses Microsoft Azure and Postgres to handle the 
            database for our system to log financial information for residents and utilizes algorithms and various 
            API's like the USPS API to automate the sign-up and verification process and make it as fast, efficient 
            and user friendly as possible. Google Analytics and Microsoft Azure captures important metrics such as 
            application completion, time required to finish and more as well as pinpointing bottlenecks in the system 
            to streamline for future revisions.

            During the summer of 2022 I was actually hired as a paid volunteer to help support Coding it Forward and 
            Second Day, two civic tech entities, in teaching and supporting a mixture of 20 under grad and graduate 
            students exploring career opportunities in civic tech! These civic tech fellows were working remotely 
            all throughout the country helping several state governments like Kentucky, Missouri and California and 
            even the CDC! I facilitated eight, one hour teaching sessions over the course of two months for these 
            civic tech fellows where I discussed civic tech as a whole, gave advice traversing the political landscape, 
            building professional government relationships as well as talking shop and supporting them with tech 
            advice for their projects. It was a very affirming and inspiring two months where I learned that the 
            younger generation are tired of the status quo and they want to change things, and I could not have 
            been happier in helping them get to their goal.

            As a student liaison to San Jose State's first ever, Paseo Prototyping Festival and Competition, 
            designed to challenging SJSU students to make San Jose a better place to live, work and play - 
            Andrew was tasked with overseeing student collaboration and filling up the competition ranks. 

            From social media engagements (Instagram and Facebook) to tried and true, boots-on-the-ground 
            marketing (tabling, fliers) and face-to-face presentations to +20 student orgs, Andrew was able 
            to drum up +300 participants for the competition. Through his connections across the many 
            disciplines of SJSU, Andrew was able to achieve a turnout that included artists, engineers, 
            industrial designers, business majors and bio-chem majors. Moreover, through his influence, 
            Andrew was even able to bring forth 10 "guest projects" from the student orgs 
            (SJSU's Hyperloop Project, SJSU's Robotics Club) that showcased their most prized projects 
            either pertaining to their curriculum or simply their interests. from the various student 
            orgs at SJSU. These guest projects were to drive the fact that this competition was a 
            celebration of all things SJSU, not just the participants. 
            
            Furthermore, through his previous experience as a two-time winning rapid prototyping 
            competition leader himself and former civic technology fellow, Andrew was in a unique 
            environment to be able to tell his story to the participants and became the vision strategist 
            for students, giving them tips on how to succeed in a civic tech based rapid prototyping 
            competition. Finally, on the day of the competition, Andrew was given the task of overseeing 
            and managing people and resources to ensure that the festival went off without a hitch, and he succeeded!

            In conjunction with San Jose politicians and the local government infrastructure, Andrew's role as a 
            Civic Tech Fellow, was to create a safer, healthier, more accessible San Jose through technology. 
            Andrew's time at Microsoft was a very unique experience - from explaining IoT and civic tech to 
            elementary school students, to creating a Raspberry Pi login system for Microsoft's partner, 
            Code for America, Andrew had taken the phrase "wearing multiple hats" to a new level.

            Andrew's project during his fellowship was the first-of-it's-kind competition titled: Spartan Hacks, 
            a Civic Tech Challenge. Andrew became the Program Manager for this competition with one thing in 
            mind: to challenge SJSU students to create technology to make San Jose a better place for her citizens. 
            Andrew coordinated and lead a team of SJSU students, partnered with his Microsoft teammates and 
            worked closely with employees of San Jose Mayor’s office to deliver this competition. Andrew worked 
            on many aspects of the project to ensure its success, including outreach, budgeting, negotiation, 
            planning and cultivating business relationships. 
            
            From creating a website to boots-on-the-ground advertising and attracting 100+ participants to 
            engaging San Jose’s CIO, Shireen Santosham, as a keynote speaker - Andrew’s capacity for outreach 
            is exceptional. Because of Andrew’s Spartan Hacks project, San Jose became a new testing ground for 
            civic tech projects which has inspired dozens of students to explore this new purpose of technology.
