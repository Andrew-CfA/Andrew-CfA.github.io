Hello!

This is the readme for my GitHub website, the way things are organized right now are like this: a branch contains a special website
the main branch is my own portfolio page and other branches are either quick proof of concept page ideas that I come up with, 
random shenanigans or even quick mock ups of assessments for jobs I may be applying for! Anyways I hope you have a good day.
