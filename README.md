Hello!

Here you will find Part 2 of the take home assessment.

For the implementation of the tabular data view, I was successful in using JavaScript to feed the data over into the website, however, I was reminded that pulling in 1000 records was not going to be a very slow process. 

So I opted to use AJAX!

Alongside AJAX, I incorporated DataTables, a JavaScript library that streamlined searching as well as allowed me to not only narrow down by borough, but all the other elements asked as well.

I then implemented the tables in each of the separate bike rack pages and incorporated a custom search term within the DataTable to better find specific information per that bike rack!

There was an idea that I had (referenced by the News Coming Soon Nav Link as well as some empty space between the "About" of a page and that pages tabular data view) where I was going to incorporate some kind of news feed (new installations, last installations, etc) per bike rack but that may be a bit beyond the time that I have!
